abstract = {Abstract A comprehensive new radiation code based on the two-stream equations in both the long-wave and short-wave spectral regions is described. The spectral resolution of the code is variable, enabling it to be used in a wide range of applications. Because of its flexibility, the code is well-suited to the investigation of the sensitivity of radiative calculations to changes in the way in which physical processes are parametrized. The gaseous transmission data are derived from a line-by-line model. Particular attention is directed towards the treatment of the water vapour continuum, the overlap between gases, and the sensitivity to changing the carbon dioxide concentrations. The performance of the code is examined both at high spectral resolution and in a lower-resolution configuration designed for the UK Meteorological Office Unified Forecast/Climate Model (UM). Particularly for use in the UM, the code must be shown to perform satisfactorily across the whole range of atmospheric conditions. Comparisons are therefore made with reference calculations in both the long-wave and the short-wave, in clear and cloudy skies, and the accuracy with which various processes may be represented is studied. For the cloudy calculations in the short-wave, a new method is presented for deriving the single-scattering properties in broad bands, based on the analytic expression for the reflectivity of an optically thick cloud. This minimizes the errors in calculating the short-wave radiative properties of water clouds when the spectral resolution is reduced to that designed for the UM. In contrast, for ice clouds the errors are minimized by deriving the single-scattering properties using linear averaging, as appropriate for optically thin clouds. In the long-wave, the vertical distribution of the radiative heating in cirrus clouds is examined at high spectral resolution. The effect of scattering of long-wave radiation, usually ignored in large-scale models, is examined in some detail and is explained using a simple model. Taking all these studies into account, it is concluded that the configuration designed for the UM retains the generality of the code, without significantly compromising the overall accuracy.},

    abstract = {We are entering the era of high-precision and high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanets. Such observations herald the need for robust self-consistent spectral models of exoplanetary atmospheres to investigate intricate atmospheric processes and to make observable predictions. Spectral models of plane-parallel exoplanetary atmospheres exist, mostly adapted from other astrophysical applications, with different levels of sophistication and accuracy. There is a growing need for a new generation of models custom-built for exoplanets and incorporating state-of-the-art numerical methods and opacities. The present work is a step in this direction. Here we introduce genesis, a plane-parallel, self-consistent, line-by-line exoplanetary atmospheric modelling code that includes (a) formal solution of radiative transfer using the Feautrier method, (b) radiative–convective equilibrium with temperature correction based on the Rybicki linearization scheme, (c) latest absorption cross-sections, and (d) internal flux and external irradiation, under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium, local thermodynamic equilibrium and thermochemical equilibrium. We demonstrate the code here with cloud-free models of giant exoplanetary atmospheres over a range of equilibrium temperatures, metallicities, C/O ratios and spanning non-irradiated and irradiated planets, with and without thermal inversions. We provide the community with theoretical emergent spectra and pressure–temperature profiles over this range, along with those for several known hot Jupiters. The code can generate self-consistent spectra at high resolution and has the potential to be integrated into general circulation and non-equilibrium chemistry models as it is optimized for efficiency and convergence. genesis paves the way for high-fidelity remote sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres at high resolution with current and upcoming observations.},

abstract="Reconciling the geology of Mars with models of atmospheric evolution remains a major challenge. Martian geology is characterized by past evidence for episodic surface liquid water, and geochemistry indicating a slow and intermittent transition from wetter to drier and more oxidizing surface conditions. Here we present a model that incorporates randomized injection of reducing greenhouse gases and oxidation due to hydrogen escape to investigate the conditions responsible for these diverse observations. We find that Mars could have transitioned repeatedly from reducing (hydrogen-rich) to oxidizing (oxygen-rich) atmospheric conditions in its early history. Our model predicts a generally cold early Mars, with mean annual temperatures below 240{\thinspace}K. If peak reducing-gas release rates and background carbon dioxide levels are high enough, it nonetheless exhibits episodic warm intervals sufficient to degrade crater walls, form valley networks and create other fluvial/lacustrine features. Our model also predicts transient build-up of atmospheric oxygen, which can help explain the occurrence of oxidized mineral species such as manganese oxides at Gale Crater. We suggest that the apparent Noachian--Hesperian transition from phyllosilicate deposition to sulfate deposition around 3.5 billion years ago can be explained as a combined outcome of increasing planetary oxidation, decreasing groundwater availability and a waning bolide impactor flux, which dramatically slowed the remobilization and thermochemical destruction of surface sulfates. Ultimately, rapid and repeated variations in Mars's early climate and surface chemistry would have presented both challenges and opportunities for any emergent microbial life.",

title = {Rocky Planet or Water World? Observability of Low-density Lava World Atmospheres},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Super-Earths span a wide range of bulk densities, indicating a diversity in interior conditions beyond that seen in the solar system. In particular, an emerging population of low-density super-Earths may be explained by volatile-rich interiors. Among these, low-density lava worlds have dayside temperatures that are high enough to evaporate their surfaces, providing a unique opportunity to probe their interior compositions and test for the presence of volatiles. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric observability of low-density lava worlds. We use a radiative-convective model to explore the atmospheric structures and emission spectra of these planets, focusing on three case studies with high observability metrics and substellar temperatures spanning ∼1900–2800 K: HD 86226 c, HD 3167 b, and 55 Cnc e. Given the possibility of mixed volatile and silicate interior compositions for these planets, we consider a range of mixed volatile and rock-vapor atmospheric compositions. This includes a range of volatile fractions and three volatile compositions: water-rich (100% H2O), water with CO2 (80% H2O+20% CO2), and a desiccated O-rich scenario (67% O2+33% CO2). We find that spectral features due to H2O, CO2, SiO, and SiO2 are present in the infrared emission spectra as either emission or absorption features, depending on dayside temperature, volatile fraction, and volatile composition. We further simulate JWST secondary-eclipse observations for each of the three case studies, finding that H2O and/or CO2 could be detected with as few as ∼five eclipses. Detecting volatiles in these atmospheres would provide crucial independent evidence that volatile-rich interiors exist among the super-Earth population.}

abstract = {Abstract Interactions between magma oceans and overlying atmospheres on young rocky planets leads to an evolving feedback of outgassing, greenhouse forcing, and mantle melt fraction. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth-similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low-mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior-atmosphere model that can simulate the time-evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun-like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth-like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host H2O \${\mathrm{H}}\_{2}\mathrm{O}\$- or H2 \${\mathrm{H}}\_{2}\$-dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by H2 \${\mathrm{H}}\_{2}\$ induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.},

    abstract = {Atmospheric energy transport is central to the cooling of primordial magma oceans. Theoretical studies of atmospheres on lava planets have assumed that convection is the only process involved in setting the atmospheric temperature structure. This significantly influences the ability for a magma ocean to cool. It has been suggested that convective stability in these atmospheres could preclude permanent magma oceans. We develop a new 1D radiative-convective model in order to investigate when the atmospheres overlying magma oceans are convectively stable. Using a coupled interior-atmosphere framework, we simulate the early evolution of two terrestrial-mass exoplanets: TRAPPIST-1 c and HD 63433 d. Our simulations suggest that the atmosphere of HD 63433 d exhibits deep isothermal layers which are convectively stable. However, it is able to maintain a permanent magma ocean and an atmosphere depleted in \$\\mathrm\{H\_\{2\}O\}\$. It is possible to maintain permanent magma oceans underneath atmospheres without convection. Absorption features of \$\\mathrm\{CO\_\{2\}\}\$ and \$\\mathrm\{SO\_\{2\}\}\$ within synthetic emission spectra are associated with mantle redox state, meaning that future observations of HD 63433 d may provide constraints on the geochemical properties of a magma ocean analogous with the early Earth. Simulations of TRAPPIST-1 c indicate that it is expected to have solidified within \$100 \\,\\mathrm\{M\}\\rm \{yr\}\$, outgassing a thick atmosphere in the process. Cool isothermal stratospheres generated by low-molecular-weight atmospheres can mimic the emission of an atmosphere-less body. Future work should consider how atmospheric escape and chemistry modulates the lifetime of magma oceans, and the role of tidal heating in sustaining atmospheric convection.},

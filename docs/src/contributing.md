# How to contribute to AGNI

## Bug reporting

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/nichollsh/AGNI/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/nichollsh/AGNI/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For more general information on submitting a bug report, visit [this page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

## Bug fixing

* Open a new GitHub pull request (PR) with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please ensure your changes are consistent with the existing codebase. These can also be viewed in the [development manual](https://www.h-nicholls.space/AGNI/dev/manual/).


## New features

* Suggest your change on the [issues page](https://github.com/nichollsh/AGNI/issues/new) and start writing code.

## Coding style
- Indentation uses 4 spaces, no tabs.
- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores .
- Lines should aim to have a length of no more than 92 characters.
- All functions should have docstrings, ideally with Arguments and Returns listed.
- More comments are always better, even if they seem redundant.
- Use type hinting where possible.
- Print statements should be made through the logger where possible.
- The core package code should not contain global variables, except in the phys module.

# AGNI
Radiative convective solver by Harrison Nicholls 

AGNI is a computer code for modelling the atmospheres of hot terrestrial (exo)planets. Its primary purpose is to solve for the atmospheric temperature structure at radiative-convective equilibrium while coupling to an interior model.

The model itself is currently proprietary. I will be made available under the BSD 3-Clause Clear License once published in a journal. Do not publish with the model before such a time; it is undergoing active development.

See the other wiki pages for information on installing the code, running the code, and obtaining results. The content of this wiki is outlined on the right hand side of this web page.

Pronounced: _ag-nee_. Named after the fire deity of Hinduism.

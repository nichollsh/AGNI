# AGNI
A numerical model for the atmospheres of hot terrestrial (exo)planets. AGNI's 
primary purpose is to solve for their temperature structures at 
radiative-convective equilibrium while coupling to an interior model.

The model itself is currently proprietary. It will be made available under the 
BSD 3-Clause Clear License once published in a journal.

        <b>A radiative-convective model for lava planet atmospheres</b>
    </p>
```

A numerical model for the atmospheres of hot rocky (exo)planets. AGNI's
primary purpose is to simulate the evolving atmospheres of magma ocean planets, while
ensuring that radiative-convective equilibrium is sufficiently maintained. Pronounced as
_ag-nee_. Named after the fire deity of Hinduism.

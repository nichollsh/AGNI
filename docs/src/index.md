# AGNI
A computer code for modelling the atmospheres of hot terrestrial (exo)planets. AGNI's primary purpose is to solve for the atmospheric temperature structure at radiative-convective equilibrium while coupling to an interior model.

The model itself is currently proprietary. It will be made available under the BSD 3-Clause Clear License once published in a journal. 

Follow [Getting started](@ref) for information on installing the code and obtaining results.

Pronounced: _ag-nee_. Named after the fire deity of Hinduism.

# Running the model
First, follow the [Getting started](@ref) instructions. Only read-on once you 
have confirmed that the code is working.  

## Tutorials
There are Jupyter notebooks containing tutorials in the `tutorials/` directory 
of the repository.

## General execution
The environment variable `RAD_DIR` must point to the SOCRATES installation 
directory. This is required for AGNI to find the SOCRATES libraries, and can be 
done by running `source path/to/set_rad_env` in your terminal.       
  
Then to use the model, simply run `./agni.jl [cfg]` where `[cfg]` is the path 
to the required configuration file. If `[cfg]` is not passed, then the default 
configuration will be used.

## Configuration 
AGNI configuration files are formatted using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/). There 
are examples in `res/config/`. The default configuration file contains comments 
explaining the purpose of each parameter, although some are explained in greater 
detail below. Take care to format the variables in the TOML file correctly. 
There are no 'default values'. Not all parameters are required in all cases, 
but the model will return an error naming any parameters which are both 
necessary and absent.

Broadly, the configuration files are broken up into four sections:
* `[planet]` -  general characteristics of the planet
* `[files]` - input/output files and other paths
* `[composition]` - atmospheric composition and chemistry
* `[execution]` - what the model should do
* `[plots]` - which plots should be produced

Some parameters:
* `execution.solution_type` tells the model which state to solve for. The allowed values (integers) are...
     - 1 : zero flux divergence at fixed `tmp_surf`
     - 2 : zero flux divergence, with `tmp_surf` set such that the conductive skin (CBL) conserves energy flux
     - 3 : the net upward flux at each layer is equal to `flux_int = sigma * tmp_int^4`
   
* `execution.solvers` tells the model which solvers to use. This is a list of strings, so multiple solvers can be applied sequentially. An empty string is always appended to the end of this list. Allowed solvers are...
     - [empty string] : no solving takes place, so the model just calculates fluxes using the initial state
     - `newton` : the Newton-Raphson algorithm is used
     - `gauss`  : the Gauss-Newton algorithm is used 
     - `levenberg` : the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm is used 
   
* `execution.initial_state` describes the initial temperature profile applied to the atmosphere. This is a list of strings which are applied in the given order, which allows the user to describe a specific state as required. The descriptors are listed below, some of which take a single argument that needs to immediately follow the descriptor in the list order.
     - `dry` : integrate the dry adiabatic lapse rate from the surface upwards
     - `str`, `arg` : apply an isothermal stratosphere at `arg` kelvin
     - `iso`, `arg` : set the whole atmosphere to be isothermal at `arg` kelvin
     - `csv`, `arg` : set the temperature profile using the CSV file at the file path `arg`
     - `con`, `arg` : apply Clausius-Clapeyron saturation curve for the gas `arg`
     - `sat` : ensure that no supersaturation occurs at the surface by removing gases as required    
  
    For example, setting `initial_state = ["dry", "sat", "H2O", "str", "180"]` will set T(p) to follow the dry adiabat from the surface, the water condensation curve above that, and then to be isothermal at 180 K until the top of the model.

* `composition.chem_type` describes the type of chemistry to implement within the model. This is handled externally by FastChem. You must also provide the path to the FastChem installation directory `fastchem_path` in the `[files]` section. The allowed values (integers) are...
     - 0 : Disabled 
     - 1 : Equilibrium, gas phase only
     - 2 : Equilibrium, with condensation (condensates retained)
     - 3 : Equilibrium, with condensation (condensates rained out)

## Outputs
Results are optionally plotted and animated, and data will be saved as NetCDF 
or CSV files.

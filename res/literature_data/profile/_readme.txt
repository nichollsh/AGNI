They represent the temperature profiles at RCE with two values for the OLR.
For the solar cases:
 - OTR274 was configured with Seff = 0.98 and Alb = 0.18.
 - OTR10000 was configured with Seff = 35.6 and Alb = 0.18.
Their Seff = 1 corresponds to a value of 341.5 Wmâˆ’2, which comes from:
    F_inst = S0 / 4, where S0=1366 Wm-2 is the solar constant.

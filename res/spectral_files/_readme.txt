These files contain data relating to the radiative transfer: gas k-tables, 
collisional absorption, droplet properties, etc.

They are pre-computed using the spectraltools in the SOCRATES repository.
Instead of using descriptive names, they are given codenames for easier tracking
and conversation relating to their use.

You can find a codename disambiguation table and further spectral files on OSF.

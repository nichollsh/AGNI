Surface single scattering albedo lookup data. These are converted to directional-hemispheric
reflectance and emissivity. This accounts for the angular dependence of the direct flux.
These values are passed to the variable `rho_alb` in SOCRATES.

All data must be in columns of:
    wavelength [nm]
    single-scattering albedo [dimensionless]

In fact, it is typically parameterised inside 3D global circulation models as resolving convection is numerically expensive. AGNI uses mixing length theory (MLT) to parameterise convection.

This takes place as follows... firstly, the mixing ratios of the gases are updated according to the temperature profile, where rainout occurs until all condensibles are saturated or sub-saturated. The mixing ratios of dry species are increased in order to satisfy the total pressure at condensing levels. The heat released associated with the change in partial pressure of condensible gases is used to calculate a latent heating rate. This is then integrated (from the TOA downwards) to provide a latent heat transport flux at cell-edges. The integrate condensible heat flux is balanced by evaporation at deeper layers.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"Latent heats are temperature-dependent, using values derived from Coker (2007) and Wagner & Pruß (2001).

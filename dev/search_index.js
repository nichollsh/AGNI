Finite-difference methods are used to estimate the jacobian matrix in this case. Similar methods have been used in a handful of planetary radiative-convective models (e.g. ATMO), but is more commonly used by the stellar physics community. Currently implemented solvers: Newton-Raphson, Gauss-Newton, and Levenberg-Marquardt. Optionally, the code uses a golden-section linesearch algorithm to determine the optimal step length.

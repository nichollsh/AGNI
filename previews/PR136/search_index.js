Quantities such as pressure and temperature are calculated at level-centres and level-edges, while energy fluxes are calculated only at the edges, and thermodynamic properties (e.g. heat capacity) are calculated only at their centres.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/#Height-structure","page":"Model description","title":"Height structure","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"The atmosphere is assumed to be hydrostatically supported.

In fact, it is typically parameterised inside 3D global circulation models, as resolving convection is numerically expensive. AGNI uses mixing length theory (MLT) to parameterise atmospheric convection. This is in contrast to convective adjustment, which forcibly adjusts a convectively unstable region of the atmosphere to the corresponding adiabat while ensuring that enthalpy is conserved.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"MLT directly calculates the energy flux associated with convective heat transport, and thus is the preferred parameterisation within the model. It assumes that parcels of gas are diffused over a characteristic mixing length, transporting energy in the process. This requires choosing a scale for this mixing length, but in practice this has very little impact on the results from the model.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"When evaluating convective energy fluxes, AGNI first calculates the temperature gradient across each layer of the atmosphere. Convection occurs within each layer that has a lapse rate dTdP greater than the critical lapse rate for triggering convection. Equations 2 to 6 of Nicholls+2025 describe the calculation of the convective energy flux under the Schwarzschild criterion. AGNI can also check against the Ledoux criterion for convective stability, which accounts for vertical gradients in the gas MMW. The atmosphere is not explicitly split into convecting and non-convecting regions, thereby allowing disconnected regions of convection.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/#Phase-change","page":"Model description","title":"Phase change","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"Gases release energy (\"latent heat\" or \"enthalpy\") into their surroundings when condensing into a liquid or solid. This is included in the model through a diffusive condensation scheme, which assumes a fixed condensation timescale. This takes place as follows... firstly, the mixing ratios of the gases are updated according to the temperature profile, where rainout occurs at each level until all condensables are saturated or sub-saturated. The mixing ratios of dry species are increased in order to satisfy the total pressure at condensing levels. The total accumulated amount of condensation (for each volatile) is then re-evaporated in the deeper atmosphere where possible. Any rain which is not re-evaporated before reaching the surface is considered to form an ocean. The heat released associated with the change in partial pressure of condensable gases is used to calculate a latent heating rate at each level (positive where condensing, negative where evaporating). The heating rates in each layer are then integrated (from the TOA downwards) to provide a latent heat transport flux at cell-edges, which the assumption being that condensation occurs by updrafts. The integrated condensable heat flux is balanced by evaporation at deeper layers which closes the energy balance.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"Latent heats are temperature-dependent, using values derived from Coker (2007) and Wagner & Pruß (2001).

This works by setting the pressure to be small, and turning off the gas opacity. With this provided, the rest of the parameters in [configuration] are redundant. With this enabled, make sure to use the appropriate solver in the [execution] table.\nexecution.solution_type tells the model which state to solve for. The allowed values (integers) are...\n1 : zero flux divergence at fixed tmp_surf\n2 : zero flux divergence such that the conductive skin (CBL) conserves energy flux with fixed tmp_magma\n3 : the net flux (up minus down) at each layer is equal to flux_int\nSee the Model description page for an explanation of these solution types.\nexecution.solver tells the model which solver to use. Allowed solvers are...\n[empty string] : no solving takes place, so the model just calculates fluxes using the initial state\nnewton : the Newton-Raphson algorithm is used\ngauss  : the Gauss-Newton algorithm is used\nlevenberg : the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is used\ntransparent : solver to be used when composition.transparent=true.\nexecution.initial_state describes the initial temperature profile applied to the atmosphere. This is a list of strings which are applied in the given order, which allows the user to describe a specific state as required. The descriptors are listed below, some of which take a single argument that needs to immediately follow the descriptor in the list order.\ndry              : integrate the dry adiabatic lapse rate from the surface upwards\nstr,       arg : apply an isothermal stratosphere at arg kelvin\niso,       arg : set the whole atmosphere to be isothermal at arg kelvin\ncsv,       arg : set the temperature profile using the CSV file at the file path arg\nsat,       arg : apply Clausius-Clapeyron saturation curve for the gas arg\nncdf,      arg : load profile from the NetCDF file located at arg\nloglin,    arg : log-linear profile between tmp_surf at the bottom and arg at the top\nana              : use the Guillot (2010) analytical temperature solution\nFor example, setting initial_state = [\"dry\", \"sat\", \"H2O\", \"str\", \"180\"] will set T(p) to follow the dry adiabat from the surface, the water condensation curve above that, and then to be isothermal at 180 K until the top of the model.\ncomposition.chemistry describes the type of chemistry to implement within the model.

The spectral files contain k-tables for pure gases, and combining these coefficients can be done in several ways. See Amundsen+2017 for a nice comparison of overlap methods.

It does this while ensuring that radiative-convective equilibrium is maintained throughout the atmosphere. SOCRATES is used to perform correlated-k radiative transfer including: shortwave irradiation from the star, surface emission, line absorption, Rayleigh scattering, parameterised clouds, and collisional absorption. Mixing length theory is used to parametrise convection. AGNI also supports real gas equations of state, self-gravitation, and various spectral surface compositions. Accounting for these energy transport processes permits an energy-conserving calculation of atmospheric structure, obtained using numerical optimisation, which also yields realistic cooling rates for young rocky planets with magma oceans.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Pronounced as ag-nee.

In fact, it is typically parameterised inside 3D global circulation models, as resolving convection is numerically expensive.

This is in contrast to convective adjustment, which forcibly adjusts a convectively unstable region of the atmosphere to the corresponding adiabat while ensuring that enthalpy is conserved.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"MLT directly calculates the energy flux associated with convective heat transport, and thus is the preferred parameterisation within the model.

This is included in the model through a diffusive condensation scheme, which assumes a fixed condensation timescale. This takes place as follows... firstly, the mixing ratios of the gases are updated according to the temperature profile, where rainout occurs until all condensibles are saturated or sub-saturated. The mixing ratios of dry species are increased in order to satisfy the total pressure at condensing levels. The heat released associated with the change in partial pressure of condensible gases is used to calculate a latent heating rate. This is then integrated (from the TOA downwards) to provide a latent heat transport flux at cell-edges. The integrated condensible heat flux is balanced by evaporation at deeper layers.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/","page":"Model description","title":"Model description","text":"Latent heats are temperature-dependent, using values derived from Coker (2007) and Wagner & Pruß (2001).

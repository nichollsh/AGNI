!+ Module to define the arrays used in the CKD continuum model.
!
MODULE ckd_extern_data
!
! Description:
!   This module defines arrays used by the CKD continuum model.
!   These arrays would usually be defined with the code, but
!   are to beig for all compilation on all machines, so a 
!   process of reading in is adopted.

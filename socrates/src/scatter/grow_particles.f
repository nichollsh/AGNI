!+ Subroutine to treat the growth of particles with humidity.
!
! Method:
!
!	THIS ROUTINE CHANGES THE LOGARITHMS OF THE MEAN AND STANDARD
!	DEVIATION OF A LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF PARTICLE SIZES, TO
!	ACCOUNT FOR GROWTH DUE TO HUMIDITY.
!
!	AUTHOR: D.L.ROBERTS.
!
!	THIS IS VERSION 6 OF THE ROUTINE. (OCT 15TH 1998)
!	VERSION 1 DID NOT ALTER THE STANDARD DEVIATION, I.E. ALL
!	PARTICLES WERE ASSUMED TO GROW AT THE SAME RATE. THIS
!	ASSUMPTION WAS RELAXED AT VERSION 2. HOWEVER, THIS
!	INTRODUCED A SUBTLE BUG: WHEN FITZGERALD'S BETA PARAMETER
!	IS NOT UNITY, ONE HAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT
!	HIS FORMULA FOR ALPHA WAS STATED IN A FORM DERIVED FOR
!	PARTICLE RADII IN MICRONS. SINCE THIS PROGRAM WORKS IN
!	METRES, ALPHA HAS TO BE INCREASED BY A FACTOR WHICH TURNS
!	OUT TO BE 10.0**( 6.0*(BETA-1) ). VERSION 3 DIFFERED FROM
!	VERSION 2 BY INCLUDING THIS FACTOR.
!       VERSION 3, HOWEVER, PRODUCED A DISCONTINUITY IN THE SIZE
!       OF THE PARTICLES AT RELATIVE HUMIDITY 0.81. VERSION 4
!       CORRECTS THIS BY INTERPOLATING BETA BETWEEN HUMIDITIES
!       0.3 AND 0.81, IN THE SAME WAY AS ALPHA HAS ALWAYS BEEN
!       INTERPOLATED. VERSION 5 IS ALMOST THE SAME AS VERSION 4,
!       BUT WITH THE UNIT CONVERSION CORRECTION ONLY APPLIED AT
!       HUMIDITIES GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.81, AS IN VERSION 3.
!       VERSION 6 DIFFERS FROM VERSION 5 IN THAT SODIUM CHLORIDE
!       IS NOW HANDLED. THE TREATMENT OF AMMONIUM SULPHATE IS
!       UNALTERED FROM VERSION 5.
!
!	ABOVE THE DELIQUESCENCE POINT, TAKEN AS 0.81,
!	THE SCHEME IS THE ONE DUE TO J.W.FITZGERALD (1975).
!	IT IS NOT VERY GOOD BUT WILL DO FOR THE TIME BEING.
!	THE HYSTERESIS EFFECT IS MODELLED BY A REGION WHERE GROWTH
!	IS LINEAR. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS IS THAT NEAR THE
!	DELIQUESCENCE POINT, THE PROBABILITY THAT A PARTICLE HAS
!	PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPOSED TO A HUMIDITY IN EXCESS OF THAT
!	NEEDED FOR DELIQUESCENCE IS HIGH, SO THAT ON AVERAGE THE
!	UPPER BRANCH OF THE GROWTH CURVE SHOULD RECEIVE A HIGHER
!	WEIGHTING THAN THE LOWER BRANCH. AT LOW HUMIDITIES THE
!	CONVERSE APPLIES.
!	NOTE THAT A CEILING IS PLACED AT A HUMIDITY OF 0.995,
!	BECAUSE OF THE HIGHLY NONLINEAR GROWTH AS SATURATION
!	IS APPROACHED. IN ANY CASE, AT SUCH HIGH HUMIDITIES THE
!	IMPACT OF AEROSOL WILL BE SWAMPED BY THE EFFECT OF CLOUD.
!
!	NOTE THAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DILUTING THE REFRACTIVE INDEX
!	OF A PARTICLE, IT IS STILL ASSUMED THAT ALL PARTICLES GROW
!	BY THE SAME FACTOR. (THIS IS RETURNED AS GROWTH_FACTOR.)
!	THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS INCONSISTENCY, BECAUSE BY THE TIME
!	BETA IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM UNITY, THE PARTICLES
!	ARE VERY DILUTE, SO THAT SMALL ERRORS IN THE AMOUNT OF WATER
!	DO NOT MAKE A LARGE DIFFERENCE TO THE REFRACTIVE INDEX.

!       -----------------------------------------
!
!       THE CODE FOR SODIUM CHLORIDE DIFFERS FROM THE AMMONIUM
!       SULPHATE CASE IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.
!       THE DELIQUESCENCE POINT IS TAKEN AS 0.75.
!       THE EFFLORESCENCE POINT IS TAKEN AS 0.42.
!       (SEE TANG ET AL 1977, J.AEROSOL SCI. 8, 149-159.)
!       ALPHA FOR SODIUM CHLORIDE IS 1.35 TIMES ITS VALUE FOR
!       AMMONIUM SULPHATE. (BETA IS THE SAME VALUE FOR BOTH
!       SUBSTANCES.)
!       NOTE THAT WE ASSUME IT IS OK TO EXTEND THE FORMULAE FOR
!       ALPHA AND BETA DOWN FROM 0.81 TO 0.75. IN VIEW OF THE
!       GRAPHS OF THESE FUNCTIONS IN FIGS 3 AND 4 OF FITZGERALD'S
!       PAPER, THIS IS PROBABLY A HARMLESS ASSUMPTION. 
!
!       EXTRA COMMENTS REGARDING AMMONIUM NITRATE.
!       -----------------------------------------
!       THE CODE FOR AMMONIUM NITRATE DIFFERS FROM THE AMMONIUM
!       SULPHATE CASE IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.
!       THE DELIQUESCENCE POINT IS TAKEN AS 0.61.
!
!       EXTRA COMMENTS REGARDING BIOMASS, BIOGENIC, AND FOSSIL-FUEL
!       ORGANIC CARBON AEROSOLS:
!       HYGROSCOPIC GROWTH FOR THOSE AEROSOL TYPE IS PRESCRIBED
!       USING ARRAYS OF GROWTH FACTORS AS A FUNCTION OF RELATIVE
!       HUMIDITY. FOSSIL-FUEL ORGANIC CARBON AEROSOLS USE THE SAME
!       FACTORS AS BIOMASS-BURNING.
!
!	WARNING.
!	--------
!
!	A SPECIAL PATCH OF CODE HAS BEEN ADDED TO GENERATE VALUES AT
!	A HUMIDITY OF 1.0. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS OUTSIDE 
!	THE ALLOWABLE RANGE OF FITZGERALD'S SCHEME. THE VALUES 
!	RETURNED HAVE NO RELATION TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AT 
!	SATURATION IN REALITY. THE POINT OF THIS PATCH IS THAT VALUES 
!	AT A HUMIDITY OF UNITY ARE NECESSARY FOR THE LOOK-UP TABLE.
!
!	THE VALUES OF ALPHA AND BETA AT HUMIDITY 1.0 ARE CHOSEN BY
!	EXTRAPOLATING LINEARLY FROM THE VALUES AT 0.995 AND A LOWER
!	HUMIDITY, LASTHUM, THAT SHOULD BE SET TO THE LAST HUMIDITY
!	VALUE BEFORE 1.0 IN THE LOOKUP TABLE. THE EFFECT OF THIS
!	IS THAT INTERPOLATION BETWEEN HUMIDITY VALUES LASTHUM AND 1.0
!	WILL GIVE THE VALUES OF ALPHA AND BETA THAT WOULD BE OBTAINED
!	BY LINEAR INTERPOLATION BETWEEN LASTHUM AND 0.995.
!
!	THIS IS STILL NOT EXACTLY IDEAL, BUT IT IS THE BEST I CAN DO
!	FOR THE TIME BEING.

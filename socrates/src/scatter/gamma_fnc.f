!+ Function to calculate the gamma-function.
!
! Method:
!	The gamma function for the fractional part of the argument is
!	evaluated using Weierstrass's formula. The integral part is
!	handled by recurrence. A correction is applied to Weierstrass's
!	formula to reduce the influence of the truncation: this is
!	derived by imposing the condition that Gamma(1)=1. The 
!	coefficient in this truncation could be precalculated, but it
!	depends on N_LIMIT and is therefore calculated here so that
!	N_LIMIT may be changed easily and consistently. With 
!	N_LIMIT=10,000, the error should be less than one part in 10^7.
!	This routine is intended only for positive arguments and is
!	not especially efficient.

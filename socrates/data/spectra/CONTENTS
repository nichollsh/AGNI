This directory contains spectral files that have been formulated for specific
purposes. The results are likely to be inaccurate if they are used for 
purposes beyond their original remit. More information is available in

ga7/:
	Contains SW and LW spectral files proposed for Global Atmosphere
configuration (GA) 7.0 and UKESM.


ga7_ref/: sp_lw_300_jm2(_k) & sp_sw_260_jm2(_k)
	High-resolution (300 band LW and 260 band SW) reference spectral
files developed in conjunction with the broadband files for GA7.


ga3_0/:
	Contains SW and LW spectral files used for Global Atmosphere
configuration 3.0/4.0/5.0/6.0 (HadGEM3 climate model).


ga3_1/:
	Contains SW and LW spectral files used for Global Atmosphere
configuration 3.1 (operational NWP global model from PS26, 16/3/11 onwards).


hadgem2/: sp_lw_hadgem1_5C
	This has been converted from spec3a_lw_hadgem1_5C, the standard
LW spectral file for HadGEM2. It was also used during the development of
HadGEM3 and for the operational global forecast model from PS20
(operational 25/11/08) onwards.


hadgem2/: sp_sw_hadgem1_5o_rlfx
	This has been converted from spec3a_sw_hadgem1_5o_rlfx, the standard
SW spectral file for HadGEM2. It was also used during the development of
HadGEM3 and for the operational global forecast model from PS20
(operational 25/11/08) onwards.


hadgem2/: sp_sw_hadgem1_5o_lean
	This has been converted from spec3a_sw_hadgem1_5o_lean. It uses a
solar spectrum from Lean (2000) data meaned over the period 1983-2004, and
updated ozone data from Wenyi Zhong (Zhong et. al. 2008), for a more
accurate treatment of the stratosphere. This has been used for HadGEM2 runs
that incorporate a time varying solar spectrum.


hadgem1/: sp_lw_hadgem1_3
	This has been converted from spec3a_lw_hadgem1_3, the standard
LW spectral file for HadGEM1.


hadgem1/: sp_sw_hadgem1_3
	This has been converted from spec3a_sw_hadgem1_3, the standard
SW spectral file for HadGEM1. This file contains errors in the
Rayleigh scattering coefficients.


hadgem1/: sp_sw_hadgem1_3r
	This is a corrected version of the standard SW spectral file for
HadGEM1. It differs from the original only with updates to the Rayleigh
scattering coefficients.


hadam4/: sp_lw_hadcm4_N
	This has been converted from spec3a_lw_hadcm4_N, the standard
longwave spectral file used in HadAM4 runs.


hadam4/: sp_sw_hadcm4
	This has been converted from spec3a_sw_hadcm4, the standard
shortwave spectral file used in HadAM4 runs. This file contains errors in
the Rayleigh scattering coefficients.


hadcm3/: sp_lw_hadcm3
	This has been converted from spec3a_lw_asol2c_hadcm3, the definitive
LW spectral file for HadCM3 runs with approved aerosol data. HadCM3 does not 
impose limits on the size of droplets or ice crystals over which 
parametrisations are valid. Limits have been added here based on the data 
of Rockel from which the file was generated.


hadcm3/: sp_sw_hadcm3
	This has been converted from spec3a_sw_asol2c_hadcm3, the definitive
SW spectral file for HadCM3 runs with approved aerosol data. HadCM3 does not 
impose limits on the size of droplets or ice crystals over which 
parametrisations are valid. Limits have been added here based on the data 
of Rockel from which the file was generated. This file contains errors in
the Rayleigh scattering coefficients.


es96_ref/: sp_lw_300_orig
	This is the original 300-band LW spectral file with data based on
HITRAN92 derived by ESFT fitting using GENLN2. The CKD continuum is version
2.1 (lines are adjusted for consistency with the CKD cut-off).


es96_ref/: sp_sw_220_r
	This is a corrected version of the 220-band SW spectral file
differing from the original only with updates to the Rayleigh scattering
coefficients. The data, based on HITRAN92, is derived by ESFT fitting using
GENLN2. The CKD continuum is version 2.1 (lines are adjusted for
consistency with the CKD cut-off). The solar spectrum is that of Labs and
Neckel (1970).


ses2/: ses_sw_jm1_1(_k) & ses_lw_jm1_1(_k)
	Spectral files containing the gaseous absorption parametrisation
from Sun Z. 2011 "Improving transmission calculations for the Edwards-Slingo
radiation scheme using a correlated-k distribution method" Q.J.R. Meteorol.
Soc. DOI:10.1002/qj.880.

Generic Notes:

Cloud data: the "type" of droplet or ice crystal is an abstract 
quantity and has no absolute meaning. So far, we have used the following 
conventional values:

        SW:

	Water: 2= Thin averaging (Slingo & Schrecker 1982)
	       3= Thick averaging (Slingo & Schrecker 1982)
	       4= Thin averaging (Pade approximant for larger range of re)
	       5= Thick averaging (Pade approximant for larger range of re)
	Ice:   2= Thin averaging (Slingo & Schrecker 1982)
               3= Thick averaging (Slingo & Schrecker 1982)
               7= ADT-based scheme for polycrystals (should be used with
                    consistent sizes of crystals)
               8= Ice-aggregate scheme (Anthony Baran)

	LW:

	Water: 1= Fit from (Slingo & Schrecker 1982) (spectral averaging is
                  not a major issue)
	       4= Thin averaging (Pade approximant for larger range of re)
	       5= Thick averaging (Pade approximant for larger range of re)

	Ice:   1= Fit from (Slingo & Schrecker 1982) (spectral averaging is
                  not a major issue)
               7= ADT scheme for polycrystals
               8= Ice-aggregate scheme (Anthony Baran)

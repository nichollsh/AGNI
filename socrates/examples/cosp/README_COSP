A version of COSP code is included in the fcm repository at src/cosp_github

To check if the actual COSP code on github differs from this version run
check_cosp_github.sh and then see if there are any differences by having 
a look at cosp_diff_to_github.out

IF YOU ARE REALLY SURE that you want to use the github version rather
than the current fcm version, you can use copy_cosp_github.sh
to overwrite relevant files with their github versions.

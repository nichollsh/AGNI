	This file contains an examples of using the code to run ICRCCM case 27 
(LW) on AER profiles.

	The files laer27... contain atmospheric profiles for ICRCCM case27
as used by the AER LBL code given in CDL format. The calculation of
fluxes can be performed using the script run27, which gives an example of
how the code is run. The files aer_... are the results from the AER LbL code
itself.

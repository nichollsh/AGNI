This directory contains input files for a case study from the CIRC
(Continual Intercomparison of Radiation Codes) project run by
Lazaros Oreopoulos at GSFC: http://circ.gsfc.nasa.gov

Case 6: Cloudy sky case, adapted from BBHRP v. 1.4.1 SGP 3/17/2000, 
julian day=77; thick overcast liquid cloud, moderate precipitable water, 
SZA=45.5 degrees.

Input files have been compiled using the IDL routine: idl/circ2nc.pro
for use with the hadgem1_3 and ses_jm1_0 spectral files.

To run the E-S code on the input files simply run the file: run_me
Output profiles can be compared to the LW reference profiles provided
by CIRC (from LBL calculations) and reference SW broad-band fluxes
given below:

SW fluxes in Wm-2 :

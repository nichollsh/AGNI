Test script for scatter_90, scatter_average_90 and prep_data provided by
Reading University. Further information can be found here:
http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~lem/large_models/esrad/run/examples/mie/

To run the script, first make sure that npd_band is set to 220 or more in 
$RAD_BIN/dimensions_spec_ucf.f90
(and recompile if necessary).

Then type, run_me, which should give an output file sp_with_aer that 
should look like sp_* depending on your compiler.
